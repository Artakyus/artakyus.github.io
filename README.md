This is one of my first attempts of building a webpage for a business.
I tried to implement some attractive integrations such as the final contact form and the google complements (maps, calendar),
as well as some client's requests, ie. the dynamic cards.

The size of the body and the different elements were made following the indications of the clients, 
although trying to keep them as most responsive as possible.
Because of this, the experience in bigger screens may be a little bit primitive/uncomfortable.

It has a lot of room for improvements. The code could be cleaner, and I would add some margins to the body for the biggest resolutions. 
Besides of that, some elements of the Contact page could be centered for a smoother view, 
and the contact form in itself is pending to be modified once I learn some more PHP.
